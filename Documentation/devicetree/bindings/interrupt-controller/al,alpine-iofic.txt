Alpine IOFIC interrupt controller

This interrupt controller hardware is a second level interrupt controller that
is hooked to a parent interrupt controller: e.g: ARM GIC for ARM-based
platforms.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "al,alpine-iofic"
- reg: physical base address and size of the registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- interrupt-parent: specifies the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts-in: number of interrupts connected to this iofic
- interrupt-parent: the phandle to the parent interrupt controller

Example:

	pbs_iofic: pbs_iofic {
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "al,alpine-iofic";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd8a8500 0x0 0x100000>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupts-in = <27>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x0 0x4>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic_main>;
	};
