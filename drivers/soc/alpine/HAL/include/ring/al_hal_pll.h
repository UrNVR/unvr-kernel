/**
 * @defgroup grouppll PLL control
 * @ingroup group_ring
 *  @{
 *
 * The chip uses three separate PLLs (refered to as south bridge PLL,
 * the north bridge PLL, and CPU PLL)
 * The SouthBridge PLL derives the frequencies to I/O Fabric, and
 * all the slow I/O interfaces.
 * The NorthBridge PLL drives the DRAM and the System Fabric
 * The CPU PLL drives the CPU cores, caches and local interrupts controllers.
 * These PLLâ€™s are independent and asynchronous to
 * each other, and support up to 16 clock channels derived from each PLL
 * frequency.
 * The PLL HAL is used for controlling each PLL separately.
 *
 * Common operation example:
 * @code
 * void sb_pll_set_ch14_ch15()
 * {
 *	int status = 0;
 *
 *	struct al_pll_obj obj;
 *
 *	enum al_pll_freq pll_freq;
 *	unsigned int pll_freq_val;
 *
 *	// Init SB PLL object
 *	// TODO: Obtain ref clock freq using the bootstrap HAL
 *	status = al_pll_init(
 *		(void __iomem *)0xFD860B00,
 *		"SB PLL",
 *		AL_PLL_REF_CLK_FREQ_125_MHZ,
 *		&obj);
 *	if (status)
 *		return status;
 *
 *	// Obtain PLL current frequency
 *	status = al_pll_freq_get(
 *		&obj,
 *		&pll_freq,
 *		&pll_freq_val);
 *
 *	// Set 100 MHz freq to channel 14 and 125 MHz to channel 15
 *	if (pll_freq_val % 100000) {
 *		al_err("PLL freq not suitable for 100MHz channel!\n");
 *		return -EINVAL;
 *	}
 *
 *	if (pll_freq_val % 125000) {
 *		al_err("PLL freq not suitable for 125MHz channel!\n");
 *		return -EINVAL;
 *	}
 *
 *	status = al_pll_channel_div_set(
 *		&obj,
 *		14,
 *		pll_freq_val / 100000,
 *		0,
 *		0,	// No reset
 *		0,	// Don't yet apply
 *		0);	// Not applying so no need timeout
 *	if (status)
 *		return status;
 *
 *	status = al_pll_channel_div_set(
 *		&obj,
 *		15,
 *		pll_freq_val / 125000,
 *		0,	// No reset
 *		1,	// Apply (both 14 and 15)
 *		1000);	// Let it 1ms to settle
 *	if (status)
