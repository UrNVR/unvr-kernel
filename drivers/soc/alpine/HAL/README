AL-HAL - Annapurna Labs Hardware Abstraction Layer - version 2.9

This a GA release

=============================================================================
Overview
=============================================================================
The Hardware Abstraction Layer is a collection of Operating System independent
low-level drivers, those drivers provide a SW API for the underlying hardware,
and OS specific device drivers can use it to provide I/O services.
Using the HAL drivers for implementing OS specific drivers will significantly
reduce the development process. The HAL drivers save the developer the time,
effort and knowledge needed to develop and test the code that directly manages
the hardware.

=============================================================================
Package Contents
=============================================================================
drivers/		Components directory with the Code HAL driver and
			hardware register header files, if exist.

include/		Components directory with an API and common library
			header files.

doc/			Doxygen API documentation for the HAL package (see
			doc/html/index.html).

samples/		Sample code for the OS service layer.

Makefile		An example makefile to build the HAL package.

=============================================================================
QuickStart
=============================================================================
Reading the documentation:
-------------------------_
Pre-built Doxygen documentation is provided in this package. In order to read
it open 'doc/html/index.html' with an internet browser.

Building the package:
--------------------_
In order to build the package natively enter 'make'. Cross compiling the package
might require modifications for the Makefile.

Building the package documentation:
